/**
 * ONE-TIME: seed real, commonsense fault/symptom codes for every Device
 * Category, so Fault Code / Symptom Code pickers aren't empty ("uncategorized")
 * for anything outside Mobile. Per explicit request ("we need to device
 * faults and symptoms of Mobile, TV, Tablet etc for all available Product
 * Category types").
 *
 * Mobile already has a decent starter set (DEFAULT_FAULT_CODES /
 * DEFAULT_SYMPTOM_CODES in FaultCode.ts/SymptomCode.ts, auto-seeded
 * globally on first API call) -- this script backfills `deviceCategory:
 * "MOBILE"` onto the subset of those whose existing `category` (component)
 * is genuinely mobile-relevant, and adds a fresh set of 10-15 fault codes +
 * 8-10 symptom codes, grouped by component, for every other category.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT: every code is looked up by its unique {businessId, code} key
 * before creating; an existing default code only gets `deviceCategory`
 * backfilled if unset, never overwritten.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN:
 *   npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/seedFaultSymptomCodes.ts
