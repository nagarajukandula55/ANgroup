/**
 * The canonical way to get the current admin's active business id on the
 * client. Was `localStorage.getItem("businessId")` on 15+ admin pages
 * (Brands, Product Categories, Material Categories, Units, Fault Codes,
 * Employees, Finance, Inventory, Sales Invoices, Agreements, Production,
 * Stock Adjustments, Stock Transfers, Inventory Lots) -- but nothing in
 * the real login/business-switching flow (sidebar.tsx's business
 * switcher, /api/auth/switch-business) ever writes that key. It's only
 * ever set by a separate, mostly-unused businessSwitcher.tsx component.
 * For any admin who never happened to touch that specific component,
 * localStorage.getItem("businessId") returned null forever, silently
 * breaking every create/edit action on all those pages with errors like
 * "name and businessId are required" even though the form was filled in
 * correctly -- there was just no businessId to send.
 *
 * This reads the same source of truth the sidebar and every other working
 * page already uses: GET /api/auth/me's user.activeBusinessId (server
 * session, kept in sync by the real business switcher).
