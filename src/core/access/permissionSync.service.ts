 * hand-writing a Permission document for every module/action combination
 * (which is how the original repo ended up with an inconsistent, partial
 * set of permission codes), every module — built-in or admin-created —
 * automatically gets one Permission per applicable standard action the
 * moment it's created, and this function is re-run whenever a module's
 * applicableActions change.
 *
 * Reuses the EXISTING Permission model from the original repo rather than
 * inventing a new one — that model already has exactly the right shape
 * (code, module, group, type SYSTEM/CUSTOM, isActive). This function is
 * purely the missing "keep it populated automatically" piece.
