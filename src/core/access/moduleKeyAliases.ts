/**
 * Sidebar nav items and permission checks (buildPermissionCode's first
 * argument) are supposed to share the same module-key namespace -- but a
 * handful of "masters-*" nav entries were given UI-only key names that
 * never matched the real module key their pages' API routes actually
 * check with requirePermission(). Business.modules[] is keyed off the
 * sidebar's nav key (see components/sidebar.tsx's STATIC_MODULES), so for
 * these entries, toggling the module ON in Business > Modules produced an
 * enabledKeys Set that never matched the real permission code's module
 * key -- a Vendor Owner's "*" (every enabled module) wildcard resolution
 * in vendorDefaultRoles.service.ts silently dropped these modules even
 * though they were visibly toggled on, and the module-enabled filter in
 * session-enriched.ts did the same for every other role. This is why
 * "Owner" looked like it granted a huge list of permissions but still
 * 403'd on a handful of real pages (Fault Codes, Solutions, Product
 * Categories among them).
 *
 * Renaming the sidebar keys outright would orphan every business's
 * already-saved Business.modules[] documents (they'd need a DB
 * migration this codebase has no safe way to run blind). Instead, both
 * call sites normalize through this alias map before matching, so an
 * existing business's saved toggle keeps working under its old key AND
 * the real permission module key it was always supposed to mean.
