/**
 * Vendor onboarding lifecycle:
 *  APPLIED          — vendor submitted the public application form
 *  PENDING          — created directly by admin (legacy default)
 *  AGREEMENT_DRAFTED — admin reviewed & approved application; a partner
 *                      Agreement document was generated, but NOT yet sent
 *                      to the vendor for signing. Distinct from
 *                      AGREEMENT_SENT below — previously this codebase set
 *                      vendor.status = AGREEMENT_SENT at the moment the
 *                      Agreement doc was merely CREATED (in
 *                      review/route.ts), which meant the admin UI would
 *                      claim an agreement was "sent" even if nobody had
 *                      clicked Send yet. This status is the real interim
 *                      state between approval and an actual send action.
 *  AGREEMENT_SENT   — the signing invitation (OTP link) was actually
 *                     dispatched, via POST /api/agreements/[id]/send —
 *                     THIS is what sets AGREEMENT_SENT now, not approval.
 *  AGREEMENT_SIGNED — vendor signed the agreement (verified via Agreement)
 *  AGREEMENT_CANCELLED — the agreement tied to this vendor (via
 *                      agreementId) was cancelled from the Agreements page
 *                      (DELETE /api/agreements/[id]) before it reached
 *                      FULLY_SIGNED. Previously cancelling an agreement
 *                      only updated the Agreement document itself — the
 *                      vendor's own status kept reading AGREEMENT_SENT
 *                      forever, and VendorDetailModal had no action button
 *                      for any post-AGREEMENT_DRAFTED state, so the vendor
 *                      was stuck with no way to re-send or restart review.
 *                      This status makes the cancellation visible on the
 *                      vendor record itself and is the trigger for
 *                      VendorDetailModal to show a "Restart Review" /
 *                      "Re-send Agreement" action.
 *  APPROVED         — admin gave final approval; vendor ID + login issued
 *  ACTIVE           — vendor is live (can manage warehouse/products/orders)
 *  INACTIVE / REJECTED / SUSPENDED — terminal / paused states
