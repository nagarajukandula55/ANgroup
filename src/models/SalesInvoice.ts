/**
 * SalesInvoice — canonical model for sales invoices.
 *
 * This schema used to be defined inline, separately, in BOTH
 * src/app/api/sales/invoices/route.ts and
 * src/app/api/sales/invoices/[id]/route.ts (the only 2 route files under
 * that path that actually exist — an earlier version of this comment
 * claimed 4, including a [id]/share/route.ts and [id]/mark-paid/route.ts
 * that don't exist in this codebase; corrected here). Both used
 * `mongoose.models.SalesInvoice || mongoose.model("SalesInvoice", InvoiceSchema)`,
 * which prevented Mongoose's OverwriteModelError but meant whichever route
 * loaded first silently won the model registration for the whole app —
 * the other file's schema definition was dead weight while still looking
 * like it controlled its own data shape.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the two inline copies weren't just textually duplicated —
 * app/api/sales/invoices/route.ts's version had a materially DIFFERENT
 * shape: a full India-GST split (supplyType, placeOfSupply, per-item
 * hsnCode/cgstRate/cgstAmount/sgstRate/sgstAmount/igstRate/igstAmount, and
 * invoice-level cgstTotal/sgstTotal/igstTotal), none of which existed on
 * this canonical model's original flat taxTotal-only shape. Simply
 * pointing that route at this file without extending it first would have
 * silently dropped GST-breakdown data on every future invoice — a real
 * data-loss risk, not just a style cleanup. All the GST-specific fields
 * below were added (as optional, additive fields) specifically to make
 * that route's actual data shape a strict subset of this schema before
 * switching it over — see the tax-split fields marked "GST breakdown"
 * below. Both routes now import this file instead of declaring their own
 * copy — this really is the single source of truth now, not just
 * documented as one.
 *
 * API routes can import this model via:
 *   import SalesInvoice from "@/models/SalesInvoice";
 *
 * ── e-Invoice (IRN) readiness ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Per explicit user decision: target ONLY the official government e-invoice
 * (IRN) system for now — the free, government-authorized Invoice
 * Registration Portal APIs (see PROGRESS.md's GST section for the research
 * on NIC vs. IRIS/Clear IRP and turnover eligibility) — and hold off on
 * wiring an actual IRP integration until that's revisited. This model was
 * extended additively with every mandatory field the official e-invoice
 * schema (FORM GST INV-01) requires that this schema didn't already have,
 * so invoice data is READY to be mapped into an IRN request the moment
 * that integration is built — no schema migration needed at that point.
 * Nothing here calls any IRP; this is purely data-shape preparation.
 * New fields: documentTypeCode, isService (invoice-level); recipient
 * address/state code (needed for place-of-supply on the e-invoice JSON,
 * distinct from the free-text `customer.address` already present);
 * assessableValue (per item — INV-01's term for taxable value after
 * discount, distinct from the pre-discount `total` this schema already
 * tracks); and the post-filing response fields (irn, ackNumber, ackDate,
 * signedQrCode, einvoiceStatus) that will hold the IRP's response once
 * that integration exists.
