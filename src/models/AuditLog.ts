 * Canonical audit log entry.
 *
 * Historically this schema only had entityType/entityId/action/by/before/
 * after/ip, but the /api/audit/logs POST handler (and now the shared
 * logAction() helper in src/lib/audit/logAction.ts) writes a richer shape —
 * businessId/userId/entity/metadata — which used to be silently stripped by
 * Mongoose since the schema was strict by default. Both the legacy fields
 * and the fields actually used across the app are kept here (entity vs
 * entityType, userId vs by) so nothing written by either call site is lost.
