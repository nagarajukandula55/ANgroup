/**
 * REMOVED: a local getNextNumber() used to live here — a TENTH
 * previously-undiscovered duplicate number generator, and the least
 * business-scoped of any of them: it found the single globally-last
 * Agreement across EVERY business on the platform (`findOne({}, ...)` —
 * no businessId filter whatsoever), sorted by `createdAt` rather than by
 * `agreementNumber` itself (so "last created" and "highest numbered"
 * could disagree if agreements were ever created out of order or backdated),
 * and derived the next number by string-splitting on "-" — fragile if the
 * prefix format ever changed. Replaced with the canonical
 * core/numbering/numberingService.ts, scoped per-business via the new
 * AGREEMENT document type (see core/numbering/types.ts).
