/**
 * POST/GET /api/admin/seed-crm-modules
 *
 * Seeds the CRM lifecycle AND the new Reports & Downloads screen as proper
 * SYSTEM ModuleDefinition rows (isSystem: true, businessId: null) — the
 * registry that actually drives both the sidebar (via
 * filterModulesByPermission + /api/ui/sidebar) and the access matrix (via
 * accessMatrix.service.ts). Kept in one route/file (rather than a
 * separately-named "seed-reports-module" route) since both were added in
 * the same pass and share the exact same seeding mechanics — route name is
 * CRM-specific for historical reasons but covers "crm", "crm_calls",
 * "crm_jobsheets", and "reports". Until this route is run once, none of
 * these have Permission rows at all, so no role (including ones a super
 * admin creates) can ever be granted access to them — this is the same
 * class of gap the codebase's own comments describe for other modules
 * ("built but never wired up").
 *
 * Safe to run multiple times: creates each ModuleDefinition only if it
 * doesn't already exist (by key + businessId: null), then always re-runs
 * syncPermissionsForModule so permission rows stay current even if this
 * route is redeployed with different applicableActions later.
 *
 * There was no existing seed path for *system* modules at all — only
 * createModuleDefinition() for business-scoped custom modules — so this
 * writes ModuleDefinition documents directly rather than going through
 * that business-scoped helper.
