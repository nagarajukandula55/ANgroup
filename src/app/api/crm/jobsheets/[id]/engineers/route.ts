/**
 * GET /api/crm/jobsheets/[id]/engineers — lists engineers eligible to be
 * assigned to this job sheet's business, for the "Assign engineer"
 * picker on the job sheet detail page.
 *
 * This used to call /api/vendor/staff (the vendor PORTAL's own team-
 * management endpoint, gated to that vendor's literal Owner account only)
 * and filter the result by BusinessMember.vendorRole === 'ENGINEER' -- a
 * free-text display label the vendor Owner types in when granting access,
 * not a reliable machine-checkable field (see resolveOwnerOrManagerVendor
 * in api/vendor/settings/route.ts for the same anti-pattern already
 * avoided there). Two bugs followed: (1) anyone opening this page who
 * wasn't literally the vendor's Owner got a 403 and silently saw an empty
 * list, and (2) even the Owner only ever matched a member whose typed
 * label was the exact string "ENGINEER". Job sheets are business-scoped
 * (CrmJobSheet has no vendorId of its own), so this now checks the real
 * granted workorder access across every vendor under this job sheet's
 * business, gated by the caller's own crm_jobsheets permission instead of
 * "are you this one vendor's Owner".
